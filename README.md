Hi, this is kami speaking to you!

How in the devil did you find this repository?
Well matters not for nought anyways.

I was pretty drunk when I was flying and making this speech to you the passengers.
Wait no I am*, anyways to those who are listening or reading we're are about to crash!

Back in my days I used to create things, I was such an engineer.
<summary>
<details>
Is what I would say if I like making shit.
</details>
</summary>

I built this plane with my bear hands! wait no bare hands D:!
You can too if you copy my techniques!
Yah just `git clone` there's some security link and none secure link ion really know whatcha like but u do u.
Then u copy the folder away without git.
Then u bash ./lib/updateNixos.

Ill tell yah more bout me updateNixos button one day.

The seats, the engine, the COCKpit and maybe more, i don't know or remnmebrer!


<h3> So what is in this plane?

Lets start with that its OPERATIONAL!!
We can use this config file<i> on the fly!</i>

<details>
HahhahahahhahahahhAHBHAbhahahh im so funny
</details>
</summary>

We have our radio and every thing moving and stationery is connected to our radio!
So you the user will use this radio to customize this plane to how you would like it to be.<br>
Will we unwind, re-wire certain parts that are connected to the radio to be separate? Have a new user? Have not everything go to shit if the radio dies?
Why of COURSE! Just not now..

So naturally our radio is pretty complex on a top down level.
Here's the log jorunal bookfor iut.
Wait, I was going to make it many years ago but I haven't started...
Well no better time than now when our plane is crashing and we'er all going to die.
